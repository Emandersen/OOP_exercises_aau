1. What is bytecode and why is it important to Java’s use for Internet programming? 

Bytecode is is a non-readable form of code which is generated for an interpreter to run. 
Its important due to its capability to be run on any platform able to run the interpreter for the given language 
the bytecode was designed for

# to do

1. Why does Java strictly specify the range and behavior of its primitive types?

2. What is Java’s character type, and how does it differ from the character type used by some other programming languages?

3. A boolean value can have any value you like because any non-zero value is true. True or False?

4. Given this output, 

One

Two

Three


using a single string, show the println( ) statement that produced it.

5. What is wrong with this fragment?



6. Explain the difference between the prefix and postfix forms of the increment operator.

7. Show how a short-circuit AND can be used to prevent a divide-by-zero error.

8. In an expression, what type are byte and short promoted to?

9. In general, when is a cast needed?

10. Write a program that finds all of the prime numbers between 2 and 100.

1. Write a program that reads characters from the keyboard until a period is received. Have the program count the number of spaces. Report the total at the end of the program.

2. Show the general form of the if-else-if ladder.

3. Given (Look in the book) to what if does the last else associate?

4. Show the for statement for a loop that counts from 1000 to 0 by –2.

5. Is the following fragment valid?

6. Explain what break does. Be sure to explain both of its forms.

7. In the following fragment, after the break statement executes, what is displayed?

8. What does the following fragment print?

9. The iteration expression in a for loop need not always alter the loop control variable by a fixed amount. Instead, the loop control variable can change in any arbitrary way. Using this concept, write a program that uses a for loop to generate and display the progression 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and so on.

10. The ASCII lowercase letters are separated from the uppercase letters by 32. Thus, to convert a lowercase letter to uppercase, subtract 32 from it. Use this information to write a program that reads characters from the keyboard. Have it convert all lowercase letters to uppercase, and all uppercase letters to lowercase, displaying the result. Make no changes to any other character. Have the program stop when the user enters a period. At the end, have the program display the number of case changes that have taken place.

11. What is an infinite loop?

12. When using break with a label, must the label be on a block that contains the break?
