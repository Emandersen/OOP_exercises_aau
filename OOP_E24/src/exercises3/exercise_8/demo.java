Problem 8
Code a Chess Game using the knowledge you have learned
about encapsulation and inheritance. Use the classes described during the
lecture as starting point:
• Chessboard is a class that stores a reference to all the pieces in the
board.
• ChessPiece is an abstract class that contains all the functionality which
is common to all the chess pieces.
• For each chess piece (e.g. Queen, King), create a class that inherits
from the abstract class ChessPiece. This class should contain all
the specific logic for this piece.
Try to code as much functionality as you can/want. Examples are:
• Move a piece from one position to another.
• King checked.
• Is White turn?
• Is Game Over?
• Is White Winner?
• Is Black Winner?
But, before implementing this functionalities, think in which class it should
be placed: ChessBoard, ChessPiece, the specific class of a given chess piece
(e.g. Queen, King, etc.) or some other new class you consider it should be
created. Consider if new methods have to be added to some of the classes,
or if you should change some of the existing ones. Try to apply the concepts
of encapsulation and inheritance as much as possible.
