/*
Problem 6.
 Write an interface to represent a file. A file is either a regular
file or a directory. Every file has a name, a creation date, and a file size.
Write classes, which implement the interface, to represent regular files and
1 directories. Moreover, a directory may contain subfiles (regular files or directories).
Add a method to the interface to return the oldest and newest
regular file.
